# 😎 Hello Hello! I'm Tega — Cybersecurity Analyst + All-Around Tech Tinkerer 🔐💻

Welcome to my GitHub — where you'll find security scripts, home lab chaos, and digital defense experiments gone (mostly) right.  
I'm a cyber nerd who loves digging into attacks, defending networks, and automating the boring stuff so I can break... I mean *test* things. 🧪🔥

## 🧠 What I Actually Do (besides drink too much coffee ☕)

- 🔍 Hunt threats like they're easter eggs
- 💥 Simulate attacks (safely, I promise)
- 🛡️ Build detections & monitor logs like a cyber gremlin
- 📚 Constantly Googling stuff I *should* know already
